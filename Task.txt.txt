You need to finish PaintComponent to resize correctly and match the bounds.


Also start working on player heirarchy.


Comment:

Added some major UI and paintComponent(). Still needs the resizing to be fixed.
Added Players.java, Bank.java.
Bank.java still needs to be implemented.
Players.java is being built up and has accessors, takeTurn(), rollDice(), getStatus(), withdraw(), and deposit(). Sort of started implementing $ system, aka Only Go Collect 200.
In GameBoard.java added private String htmlName to all BoardPieces and it's own constructor also. GameBoard.java also added loadBoardData() and loadBoardPieces() for initialization. I also added accessors getBoardPieces() for the List and getBoardPiece(int position) for specific BoardPiece panels.
Finally, moved all of the files to one package AssignmentX;
