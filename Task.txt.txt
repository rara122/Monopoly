You need to finish PaintComponent to resize correctly and match the bounds.


Also start working on player hierarchy.
Work on Player turn system and rolling and taking turns.
Also start working on Money System.


Comment:

Added some major UI and paintComponent(). Still needs the resizing to be fixed.
Added Players.java, Bank.java.
Bank.java still needs to be implemented.
Players.java is being built up and has accessors, takeTurn(), rollDice(), getStatus(), withdraw(), and deposit(). Sort of started implementing $ system, aka Only Go Collect 200.
In GameBoard.java added private String htmlName to all BoardPieces and it's own constructor also. GameBoard.java also added loadBoardData() and loadBoardPieces() for initialization. I also added accessors getBoardPieces() for the List and getBoardPiece(int position) for specific BoardPiece panels.
Finally, moved all of the files to one package AssignmentX;



Updated UI elements: 
	- nameLabel of BoardPieces foreground and background updated.
	- changed some of the resizing to better adapt, Still needs to be fixed (possibly to gridbaglayout)
Added constructors to Monopoly 
Added functions to Monopoly: 
	- takeTurn(int) //takesTurn & positions player --> return nextplayer
	- positionPlayer(int) //This is currently just a comment, needs to be fixed
Changed Random's Seed to default constructor so multiple instances of Player don't Random to the same Seed.
Added class PlayersPanel to Players.java 
Check to see what paintComponents need to be overridden
Added JPanel monopolyBoard to Monopoly and a sidePanel with players and a Button.
