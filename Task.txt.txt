Comments:
Made UI update playerTokens as they roll and balances as well.
Redesigned so that Monopoly's hierarchy of composition is better suited with the code.
	- Monopoly has 1 GameBoard.
	- GameBoard has at least 2 Player(s).
	- Player have a 1 to 1 mapping to a PlayerPanel.
	- BoardPiece.java has it's own .java file now rather than complicating GameBoard.java.
Commented the code for clarification and readability.
Changed some of the function calls and return values to better correspond to what it ACTUALLY needs to do.
Added private boardPiecePanelCenters[] so I can access Centers of boardPiecePanels.
Added JLabel playerTokens added into boardPiecePanelCenters[].
